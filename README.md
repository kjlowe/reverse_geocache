# Reverse Geocaching Box

Firmware for a box that only opens one place on earth. 

Based on code from Arduiniana written by Mikal Hart. "Reverse Geocache" is a trademark of Mikal Hart.
  
This code is written for a reverse geocaching box. The box is activated by pressing a button. If the box is in the correct location it will unlock. If the user passes a certain number of attempts, the box will never open.

My version of the box uses the following hardware:
- Arduino UNO
- Modified Sparkfun GPS Shield with Pololu Switch and headers
- EM-406A SiRF III GPS Receiver
- LK202-25-WB - 2x20 LCD from Matrix Orbital
- Parallax Servo
